# Adding custom languages
## About languages
A language consists of a lang file where all text displayed in Minecraft can be changed. The name of the language file
is languagecode.lang so for example en_us.lang.

RPW provides a tool for creating custom languages. To open it, go to `Tools > Manage languages`.

### Add / Edit / Delete a language

To add a language, click the `New` button on the left of the manage languages window. A new window will then appear
where you choose the name, region and code of your language. You can also choose if it's bidirectional which means that
it's read from right to left instead of left to right. Click ok to add your language.

To edit a language select a language from the list and click the `Edit` button in the middle. Your language file will
now be opened either in rpw's builtin text editor or your chosen one depending on your settings. To modify text change
what's after the equal sign.

To remove a language select a language form the list and click the `Delete` button to the right. Click yes in the popup
window to delete your language.
