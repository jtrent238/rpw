# Resource pack library

Library is a place where RPW keeps imported resource packs. Technically, it's a 
folder in RPW's working directory, where their archives are unpacked.

Packs in library can be used for **remixing**, you can select to use files from 
a pack by right-clicking on a group or file in the main asset tree.


## Managing library

All commands to work with library are located in the `Library` menu.

Apart from working with library packs, there is also a Select target Minecraft version dialog located at
`Library > Select target Minecraft version` where you can choose which Minecraft version to use. To inport a new Minecraft
version click the new button and select the correct version. You will also have the option to include mod files. After
changing or inporting a new Minecraft version the tree will rebuild so that you will see the assets from that version.
