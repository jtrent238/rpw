# Goals of RPW

This tool is designed to provide a convenient way of creating, editing and 
combining resource packs.

## Main features

RPW keeps a **library of imported resource packs** which you can use for 
remixing.

Your resource packs are in **projects**, so it's easy to switch between them 
and work on more than one at a time.

RPW includes a tool for adding **custom sounds** ("Sound Wizard"), and you can 
use the built-in text editor for editing text files. RPW also includes a tool for adding **custom languages** which you can
read more about on the custom languages page.

Audio and image files can be edited using an **external application** of your 
choice, which you can pick in `Options > Configure editors`.
